# 🇮🇳 Strategic Analysis of India’s Trade Deficit (2021-2023)

## 📌 Executive Summary
This project investigates the primary drivers of India's trade imbalance. By analyzing high-value commodity flows, I identified that while Petroleum dominates by volume, Gold's high unit price creates a comparable financial strain, largely driven by imports from Switzerland.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **SQL:** Data cleaning, multi-year aggregation, and unit price modeling.
* **Tableau:** Interactive dashboarding, geospatial mapping, and dual-axis visualization.
* **VS Code & Git:** Version control and project documentation.

## 📊 Business Insights
* **Deficit Concentration:** Gold and Coal are the leading drivers, with a combined deficit exceeding ₹970K.
* **Strategic Partners:** Switzerland is the primary supply node for Gold, accounting for the majority of import value.
* **Volume-Value Parity:** Petroleum requires 86x more logistical volume than Gold to achieve a similar trade deficit impact.
