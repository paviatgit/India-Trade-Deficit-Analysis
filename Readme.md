# 🇮🇳 Strategic Analysis: India’s Trade Imbalance (2021-2023)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive investigation into the primary drivers of India's trade deficit over a three-year period. By performing deep-dive analysis on multi-year trade flows, I identified critical deficit concentrations and analyzed the unit economics of high-value vs. high-volume imports. This project serves as a cornerstone of my professional data analytics portfolio.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Skills
* **Data Sourcing:** Raw datasets extracted from the **Indian Government Trade Portal**.
* **Data Processing & ETL:** Executed end-to-end data preparation using **Excel** and **MySQL** for robust data integrity.
* **Analytical Environment:** Developed and documented using **VS Code**.
* **Visualization & BI:** High-fidelity interactive dashboards built in **Tableau**.
* **Version Control:** Managed project lifecycle and documentation via **Git & GitHub**.

## ⚙️ Data Engineering & ETL Workflow
To ensure high-quality analytical outputs, I performed a rigorous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process:
* **Extraction:** Sourced and consolidated complex trade records from official government repositories.
* **Transformation:** Leveraged **MySQL** to perform data cleaning, standardized commodity nomenclature, and calculated net trade balances across disparate fiscal years.
* **Loading:** Streamlined processed datasets into Tableau to enable geospatial mapping and dual-axis trend analysis.

## 📊 Strategic Business Insights
* **Deficit Concentration:** Identified Gold and Coal as the primary drivers of the trade gap, totaling a combined deficit exceeding ₹970K.
* **Global Supply Nodes:** Pinpointed Switzerland as the most critical supply partner for high-value gold imports.
* **Unit Economics:** Analyzed volume-value parity, revealing that Petroleum requires 86x the logistical volume of Gold to exert a similar impact on the national trade balance.
